How do you feel about upgrading R?
Self-identify and share something you may be worried about in the chat:

* `r emo::ji("sunglasses")` Already upgraded
* `r emo::ji("grinning_face")` Not worried 
* `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")` Not too worried 
* `r emo::ji("confused")` A little worried
* `r emo::ji("fearful")` Very worried
* `r emo::ji("dizzy_face")` Confused about why anyone is worried

# Upgrade R // Install As You Go

You can "start fresh" with no packages installed when you upgrade R.

knitr::include_graphics('https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/077/so_good.png')
```

* Another option is to use {pacman} that installs packages that are not already installed but mentioned in code.
* For previously written scripts, RStudio provides a helpful message if it detects a package that is not installed.

# Do Not Upgrade R

Even if you’d rather wait for R v4.1.0, there are a few things you can do:

* Test it out before you upgrade
* Make it so you can switch between R versions: use RSwitch on macOS by @hrbrmstr

# Considerations

* How do you code?
* How feasily can you refind your non-CRAN packages?
* How fragile in your code?
* Do you want a 'fresh start'?
* Will your packages work with R 4.0.0?
* What do your dependencies look like?
* How fast is your internet?
* How quick is your deadline?

## Introducing: `renv`

- Oct 2019: `renv 0.8.0` released on CRAN 
- Feb 2020: latest release (`renv 0.9.3`)

Goal is for `renv` to be a stable replacement to `Packrat`

### Philosophy of `renv` 

> Any of your existing workflows should just work as they did before

---
# Workflow overview:


- `renv::init()`: Initialize a new project-local environment with a private R library
- Business as usual, installing and removing new R packages as needed
- `renv::snapshot()`: Save the state of the project library to the lockfile
- More business as usual
- `renv::snapshot()`: Save project library again
- `renv::restore()`: Revert to the previous state as encoded in the lockfile if your attempts to update packages introduced some new problems.

Available on CRAN:

```{r schrute-head, tidy=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options=c('striped', 'hover', 'condensed', 'responsive'), font_size=7)
```

---

Being good package managers and reproducible data scientists, let's

1. Start an R project
2. Start a reproducible report in R Markdown <sup>1</sup>
3. Set up `renv`:

```{r tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
renv::init()
```

This will initialize a `lockfile` with all packages and dependencies detected in the project.

Let's look at average IMDB ratings over the seasons:

```{r office_stats, tidy=FALSE}
theoffice %>% 
  select(season, imdb_rating) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarize(avg_imdb = mean(imdb_rating))

```

---
## Make a quick ggplot...

.pull-left[
```{r tidy=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
theoffice %>%
  select(season, imdb_rating) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(imdb_rating)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=season, y=avg_rating)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```
]

Sounds about right to Office fans:

- First few seasons were great
- Slump in middle
- Things got weird at the end
- Slight recovery with final season

# Share with the world!

- You share code on GitHub
- Eager to build on your groundbreaking results, collaborators fork your repo

# How about some flair?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height=100}
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.imgflip.com/1hzigk.jpg')
```

--

After all your hard work on your report that you've now shared with the world, you find out about the brand new `flair` package <sup>1</sup>. 

This is a perfect way to highlight those tricky code bits to help your co-workers learn R.

.footnote[
[1] Just released on May 4th!
]

---

# Install from CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("flair")
```

--

Now our lockfile is out of date! 


--

That's a simple fix: `renv::snapshot()` will update the lockfile. 

--

Next, revise your code with the appropriate number of flair:

```{r decorate, eval=FALSE}
decorate('theoffice %>%
  select(season, imdb_rating) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarize(avg_imdb = mean(imdb_rating))') %>%
  flair('%>%') %>%
  flair('theoffice', background='Coral') %>%
  flair('mean', background='Aquamarine')
```

# Deeper dive

`renv::init()` creates:

- lockfile named `renv.lock`
- project-local environment with private library (`renv/library`)
  - separate from system libary
  - created by crawling for dependencies with `renv::dependencies()`
  - Packages copied from user library if already installed
    - Instead of re-installing from CRAN

````{r, echo=F, out.height=200, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/project-library.png")
````

---

# Deeper dive

- `renv::snapshot()`: saves state of project to lockfile (`renv.lock`)

--

- `renv::restore()`: reverts to previous state of lockfile if package installation attempts are unsuccessful


---

# Package sources

Compatible with 

- CRAN
- GitHub
- BioConductor
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- Custom/local packages

The `DESCRIPTION` file of a package is used to infer the source

---
# Comparison with Packrat<sup>1</sup>:

1. `renv.lock` is a JSON file, ease of use with other tools
2. `renv` doesn't attempt to track package tarballs
3. `renv` doesn't track "stale" packages, installed but not recorded in lockfile
4. `renv` uses a global cache across all projects maintained with `renv`, reducing disk space
5. More configurable dependency discovery

.footnote[
[1] Abbreviated from `renv` documentation website
]

---

# Collaboration

As in the `schrute`/`flair` example, collaboration is easiest with a centrol version control repository (like GitHub)

-- 
Collaborators can run `renv::init()` from `renv.lock` included in repository. 

-- 

Collaborators can update lockfile with any packages they install via `renv::snapshot()` and then push updated lockfile to central repo. 


---
# Use with Python

If your project uses both R and Python ,(hen `renv` can manage both!

---

Compatible with

- `reticulate`
- Virtual environments
- Conda environments

---

# Conclusion

- Learning a new language can motivate you to improve skills in a language you already know

--

- R has an exciting new option for improving reproducibility even more

--

- `renv` has lots of options and flexibility but retains simplicity
